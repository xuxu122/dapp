# Dapp
A decentralized application that registers your certificate on the blockchain
 This is a web based application that generates a web based application of the certificate of the holder.
 The certificate is specified by the owner of the web UI.
 In the web UI, there are three major things,
 1. The count of the holders.
 2. Block address from where the data of the holder is pulled in the web UI.
 3. The name and level of the holder of the certificate.
 
 This framework of this certificate web UI is based on multiple smart contracts using solidity.
 The blockchain is generated through a local host (Ganache-Cli) or online server(Meta Mask(Ropsten testnet)).
 The server is ran on yarn v1.13.0.
 
 The content also contains a JSON file which is used for the dependencies for the lite-server v.2.4.0 under the MIT license for testing yarn.
